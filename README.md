> This project enhances a Django blog application by implementing a complete user authentication system. The system includes user registration, login, logout, and profile management to support a personalized user experience. Django’s built-in authentication views handle login and logout, while custom views manage registration and profile editing. A customized UserCreationForm adds email support for new users, and templates for all authentication pages—login, registration, logout, and profile—were created and styled with the project’s CSS. URL routes such as /login, /logout, /register, and /profile were added for clear navigation. Profile management allows authenticated users to update their personal information, and all views include CSRF protection and rely on Django’s password hashing for security. The authentication system was tested thoroughly to ensure correct functionality, secure user handling, and a smooth workflow throughout the application.

## Install

```sh
class CustomUserCreationForm(UserCreationForm):
```

## Usage

```sh
    email = forms.EmailField(required=True)
```
